  POST /api/admin/upload — issues a short-lived token so the browser can upload
  an image straight to Vercel Blob.

  Why client uploads rather than posting the file through this function: a
  serverless request body is capped at 4.5 MB, and a photograph straight off a
  phone is routinely larger. Proxying would work in testing and then fail on the
  owner's real photos, which is the worst kind of bug. Going direct removes the
  cap entirely.

  Auth is enforced inside onBeforeGenerateToken as well as at the top of the
  handler. That matters: the token is what actually grants write access, so the
  check has to sit on the path that mints it, not only on the way in.

  SVG is deliberately absent: it can carry script, and blob storage serves files
  inline, so an uploaded SVG would be stored XSS on the storage origin.

  Known limit: this list filters the content type the BROWSER declares — nothing
  sniffs magic bytes — so an authenticated caller could store arbitrary bytes
  labelled `image/png`. The blob is then served with that declared type, and the
  `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header set in vercel.json stops a browser
  re-interpreting it as HTML. Behind admin auth plus nosniff, the residual is
  accepted rather than unnoticed.
